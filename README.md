# RayCasting
The project in this repository is implemented in the C programming language and using the minilibx graphics library, allows basic window creation, image manipulation, pixel handling, and display within the window. Its main goal is to utilize one of the oldest 3D rendering techniques, known as raycasting (as famously used in Wolfenstein 3D). The raycasting lines are implemented using the Bresenham algorithm, which is highly optimized and avoids floating-point operations. Additionally, logical operators were employed to enhance optimization, and data pooling was applied to prevent the creation of new data spaces in each loop iteration.
